This project was taken from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libccgi/ and
modified here for my own purposes. All credit goes to Stephen C. Losen.

You may need to edit Makefile and t/Makefile to specify where
your openssl include files and libraries are located.  To build
without openssl see the comments in Makefile.

To build: make

To test:  make test  (requires openssl)

To install:
  copy libccgi.a to a lib directory such as /usr/local/lib
  copy ccgi.h to an include directory such as /usr/local/include
